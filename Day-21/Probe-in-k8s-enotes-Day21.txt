 container:
  livenessProbe:
   path:  /var/www/html/tgIndia
   port: 8080
   initialDelaySeconds: 15
   periodSeconds: 10
   
 
2) redinessProbe

				Is pod ready to serve the network traffic ?

						Remove the pod from the service of Load Balancer 
					
spec:
 container:
  redinessProbe:
   httpGet:

    port: 80
    initialDelaySeconds: 15
    periodSeconds: 10

	    |
	 keep liveness and rediness probe disabled and apply startupProbe 
	 
	 
	 
spec:
