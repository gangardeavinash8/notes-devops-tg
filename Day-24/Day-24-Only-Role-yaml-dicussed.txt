RBAC

Each and every role / clusterrole can assign by root user to local user.

-----------------------------------

Role-based access control (RBAC) refers to the idea of assigning permissions to users based on their role within an organization.

What are role and clusterole Set of permissions

	Role        ---> For particular namespace 
	ClusterRole ---> For cluster scoped object 


Type of role:

	Node administrator
	Storage administrator
	Cluster administrator
	Developer administraor [ Pod Reader ]

----------------------------------------------------------
		role 		--->		rolebindings		
		clusterrole --->		clusterrolebindings

		kubectl  api-reosurces |  less
		
		
		
	apiGroup
	/	\
  core   named group  
  group    (apps)
   (v1)		deployment, replicaset, secret, services
   pod		
   
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 Role and RoleBindings
 
 Step-1   Execute two yaml i.e. as per shared in google drive for Role and Rolebindigs
 
			( Only root user will run these yaml)
 
 Step-2 Now login with intended user (harman)  and try to edit   /home/harman/.kube/config file

	and set data as per snapshot given in Google drive
	
				vi   /home/harman/.kube/config 
				
				
	
 Step-3  Now try to deploy / pod using some yamls
	
		( Only run by user harman )
		
 Step-4  Cross check cluster and pods / deployment 
 
		kubeclt get deploy -n mytg

Assignment:  I have already shared on yaml which contains both ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBindings code
so only need to run this yaml and also make sure to update local user harman config file ( Manifest ). So that we can get appropriate output.
