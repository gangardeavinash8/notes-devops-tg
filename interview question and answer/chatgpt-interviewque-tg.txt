**Proper Answers to Each Question**

### 1. What is CI?  
**Continuous Integration (CI)** is a development practice where developers frequently merge code changes into a shared repository. Automated builds and tests are triggered upon each integration, ensuring early detection of errors.

### 2. What is the use of CI?  
CI helps in automating the integration of code changes, reducing integration conflicts, detecting bugs early, and improving software quality. It ensures faster feedback loops for developers.

### 3. What is DevOps?  
**DevOps** is a combination of **Development (Dev)** and **Operations (Ops)** practices that focus on automation, collaboration, and continuous delivery to improve software development and deployment efficiency.

### 4. What is CD?  
CD stands for **Continuous Deployment** or **Continuous Delivery**:  
- **Continuous Delivery** ensures code is always in a deployable state but requires manual approval for production deployment.  
- **Continuous Deployment** automates the entire deployment process without manual intervention.

### 5. What is Git?  
**Git** is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code. It allows multiple developers to collaborate efficiently and provides features like branching, merging, and history tracking.

### 6. What is version control?  
**Version control** is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that specific versions can be retrieved later. It enables developers to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate effectively.

### 7. What is Continuous Deployment?  
**Continuous Deployment (CD)** is the practice of automatically deploying every change that passes automated tests to production, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

### 8. What is Continuous Testing?  
**Continuous Testing** is the practice of running automated tests throughout the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that new code changes do not introduce bugs or break functionality.

### 9. Why is Continuous Testing important?  
Continuous Testing helps in identifying defects early, improving software quality, reducing the risk of deployment failures, and ensuring smooth application delivery.

### 10. What is the DevOps pipeline?  
A **DevOps pipeline** is an automated workflow that includes stages such as code integration, testing, building, containerization, deployment, and monitoring. Tools like Jenkins, Git, Docker, and Kubernetes are commonly used.

### 11. What are the features of Jenkins?  
Jenkins provides:
- Automated build and deployment
- Integration with various tools (Git, Docker, Kubernetes)
- Plugin support for extended functionality
- Distributed build execution
- Scheduling and triggering of jobs

### 12. What is Groovy in Jenkins?  
**Groovy** is a scripting language used in Jenkins for writing pipeline scripts and automating CI/CD workflows.

### 13. How do you install Jenkins?  
On a Linux system:
```
yum install jenkins -y
```

### 14. Which commands can be used to begin Jenkins?  
- `systemctl start jenkins.service` → Start Jenkins  
- `systemctl enable jenkins.service` → Enable Jenkins at boot  
- `systemctl status jenkins.service` → Check Jenkins status  

### 15. What is "Continuous Integration" with reference to Jenkins?  
In Jenkins, **Continuous Integration** means automatically fetching the latest code from a repository, running tests, and building the application to detect issues early.

### 16. Differences between CI, CD (Delivery), and CD (Deployment)?  
- **CI (Continuous Integration):** Merging and testing code changes frequently.
- **CD (Continuous Delivery):** Ensuring code is always deployable, but deployment requires manual approval.
- **CD (Continuous Deployment):** Fully automating deployment without manual approval.

### 17. Name the three different types of pipelines in Jenkins?  
- Freestyle Pipeline
- Scripted Pipeline
- Declarative Pipeline

### 18. How can you set up a Jenkins job?  
By navigating to **Jenkins Dashboard > New Item > Freestyle or Pipeline Job > Configure & Save**.

### 19. Name the two components that Jenkins is mostly integrated with.  
- Git
- Docker

### 20. Name some useful plugins in Jenkins.  
- Git Plugin
- Docker Plugin
- Kubernetes Plugin

### 21. How can you create a backup and copy files in Jenkins?  
Copy the `JENKINS_HOME` directory to a backup location.

### 22. How can you deploy a custom build of a core plugin?  
Upload the `.hpi` file in **Manage Jenkins > Plugin Manager**.

### 23. Steps to move or copy Jenkins from one server to another?  
1. Backup `JENKINS_HOME`
2. Copy it to the new server
3. Install Jenkins
4. Restore the `JENKINS_HOME` directory
5. Restart Jenkins

### 24. Name some CI tools other than Jenkins.  
- GitHub Actions
- GitLab CI/CD
- CircleCI
- Travis CI

### 25. Explain how Jenkins works.  
Jenkins automates software development by:
1. Pulling code from Git
2. Running automated tests
3. Building the application
4. Deploying it to staging/production

### 26. What would you do if a Jenkins pipeline job fails?  
Check the **Jenkins logs**, identify the issue, and fix the code or configuration.

### 27. Differentiate between Maven, Ant, and Jenkins.  
- **Maven:** A build automation tool that manages dependencies.
- **Ant:** A Java-based build tool used for compiling and packaging.
- **Jenkins:** A CI/CD tool that automates the build, test, and deployment processes.

### 28. Differentiate between Bamboo and Jenkins.  
- **Bamboo:** Paid CI/CD tool by Atlassian.
- **Jenkins:** Open-source CI/CD tool with strong community support.

### 29. How to integrate Git with Jenkins?  
Install the **Git plugin** and configure credentials (SSH key or username/password).

### 30. How to integrate Kubernetes with Jenkins?  
Use **Jenkins Kubernetes Plugin** and configure **Kubernetes agents**.

### 31. How to configure third-party tools in Jenkins?  
Install plugins via **Manage Jenkins > Plugin Manager**.

### 32. What to do if there is a broken build in Jenkins?  
Check logs, identify the issue, fix it, and restart the build.

### 33. How to deploy a custom build of a core plugin?  
Use `image pull secret` for authentication with Docker registry.
