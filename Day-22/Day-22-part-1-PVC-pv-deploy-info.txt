There are three important API resources when it comes to managing stateful applications in Kubernetes:

StatefulSet (STS)
PersistentVolume (PV)
PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)


PV and PVC 
--------------
persistant volume (PV) and persistant volume claim (PVC)

kubectl api-resources |  less

	PV are not namespace oriented.
	PVC are come under the namespace.

now you have to create 2 yaml for pv and pvc and 1 yaml (manifest) for Nginx deploy with Claim storage (PVC).

1. pv.yaml
2. pvc.yaml
3. nginx-deploy-with-pvc.yaml
